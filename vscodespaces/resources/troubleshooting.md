# Troubleshooting VS Online

- Export logs

## Self-hosted environments

### Restore a self-hosted environment

If your self-hosted environment becomes unavailable, you can attempt to restore it on the registered machine. 

Right-click the self-hosted environment in the **VS Online** panel to reveal a context menu with a **Restore Local Environment** option. This option is only visible if you are currently working on the machine registered as a self-hosted environment.

Select the **Restore Local Environment** option and wait for a notification toast indicating that the environment has been restored.
